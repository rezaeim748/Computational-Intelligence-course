# Computational Intelligence Course Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects developed as part of the **Computational Intelligence Course**. The projects focus on various methods and algorithms used in the field of computational intelligence, including neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and fuzzy logic.

## Repository included

### 1. **Neural Networks**
A project that explores the basics of neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras to solve classification problems.
### 2. **Evolutionary Algorithms**
Implementation of genetic algorithms to optimize mathematical functions and solve optimization problems.
### 3. **Fuzzy Logic Systems**
A fuzzy logic-based system to model real-world decisions, focusing on handling uncertainty in data.

## How to Run
Each project has its own set of instructions for compilation and execution. Please refer to the individual project folders for detailed README files that explain how to run each project.
