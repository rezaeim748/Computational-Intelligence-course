# Evolutionary Game Development Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the **evolutionary design and development of a game**. The goal is to use evolutionary algorithms within the game to improve its mechanics, performance, and adaptability. The system evolves through various stages, making the game more efficient and capable of handling complex tasks over time.

## Project Goals

- **Adaptability**: The game will adapt to different gameplay scenarios and challenges, ensuring a dynamic experience for players.
- **Efficiency**: Each iteration will optimize the game's performance, reducing execution time and resource usage.
- **Scalability**: The game will be designed to scale with increasing complexity and functionality as new features are added.

## Key Features

- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Evolutionary algorithms will be applied to improve gameplay mechanics and system performance. These algorithms, inspired by natural selection, will evolve the game’s components to enhance decision-making and adaptability.
- **Incremental Development**: The game is developed in stages, allowing continuous improvement through iterative enhancements.
- **Testing and Optimization**: Each stage of development will undergo testing and optimization to ensure that the game evolves to meet its design goals.

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rezaeim748/evolutionary-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd evolutionary-game
   ```

3. Run the main game script:
   ```bash
   python src/game.py
   ```

4. To run version 2 of the game:
   ```bash
   python src/game_v2.py
   ```

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
evolutionary-game/
│
├── src/
│   ├── game.py            # Initial version of the game
│   ├── game_v2.py         # Version 2 of the game with improvements
│
├── docs/
│   └── plots.docx         # Documentation on game evolution and key data visualizations
│
├── README.md              # Project overview and instructions
├── .gitignore             # Git ignored files configuration
└── LICENSE                # License information
```

## How It Works

This project uses evolutionary algorithms within the game's structure to continuously improve performance. The game starts with a basic version (`game.py`) and evolves over time with more sophisticated versions (e.g., `game_v2.py`). 

- **Initial Phase**: A basic game is designed and implemented.
- **Version 2**: The game is improved and optimized based on testing and performance data from the initial version.
